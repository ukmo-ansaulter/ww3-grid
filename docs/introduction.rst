Introduction
=============

This repository contains tools to generate and work with Spherical-Multiple-Cell
(SMC) grids for WAVEWATCH III.  Code is based library is based on several bits
and pieces of code have been cobbled together into a common library and modified.
Tools provided here are very much a work in progress, and are in various stages
of completeness. 

The main python class::

    SMCPy/         - Main python class for creating SMC grids
    SMCPy/fortran/ - Fortran code for generating face arrays
    SMCPy/matlab/  - Matlab gridgen code for generating bathy
    SMCPy/bathy/   - C based alternative code for generating bathy
    examples/      - Examples of how this library is used

Other bits and pieces::
    
    smc            - Python code for generating plots from smc flat output files
    idl            - IDL scripts for producing SMC grids
    ww3_src        - Alterations to ww3 code 
    docs           - Project documentation 


Documentation presented here is a work in progres....
